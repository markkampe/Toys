#     accept ssh from our two homes or from one trusted external site.
#   - We have to use real IP addresses, because the DDNS names do not support
#     reverse lookup.
#   - After a power failure, our cable modem is likely to be allocated a new IP address,
#     which is not yet listed in hosts.allow or known to ddns.net.
#

# ask Google what our current external IP address is
# use DNS to look up the (hopefully still valid) address of our other home system.
